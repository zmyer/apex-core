Apache Apex Command Line Interface
================================================================================

Apex CLI, the Apache Apex command line interface, can be used to launch, monitor, and manage Apache Apex applications.  It provides a developer friendly way of interacting with Apache Apex platform.  Another advantage of Apex CLI is to provide scope, by connecting and executing commands in a context of specific application.  Apex CLI enables easy integration with existing enterprise toolset for automated application monitoring and management.  Currently the following high level tasks are supported.

-   Launch or kill applications
-   View system metrics including load, throughput, latency, etc.
-   Start or stop tuple recording
-   Read operator, stream, port properties and attributes
-   Write to operator properties
-   Dynamically change the application logical plan
-   Create custom macros


## Apex CLI Commands

Apex CLI can be launched by running following command

    apex

Help on all commands is available via “help” command in the CLI

## Examples

An example of defining a custom macro.  The macro updates a running application by inserting a new operator.  It takes three parameters and executes a logical plan changes.

```
apex> begin-macro add-console-output
macro> begin-logical-plan-change
macro> create-operator $1 com.datatorrent.lib.io.ConsoleOutputOperator
macro> create-stream stream_$1 $2 $3 $1 in
macro> submit
```


Then execute the `add-console-output` macro like this

```
apex> add-console-output xyz opername portname
```

This macro then expands to run the following command

```
begin-logical-plan-change
create-operator xyz com.datatorrent.lib.io.ConsoleOutputOperator
create-stream stream_xyz opername portname xyz in
submit
```


*Note*:  To perform runtime logical plan changes, like ability to add new operators,
they must be part of the jar files that were deployed at application launch time.
